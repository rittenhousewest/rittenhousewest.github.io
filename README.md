### Jennifer Rittenhouse West, Ph.D.

Theoretical particle physicist and postdoctoral researcher.  
I work primarily on Quantum Chromodynamics — diquarks, hidden-color states in nuclei, higher Fock states of hadrons - any rigorous prediction of SU(3)_color is on my radar.
My interests span from collider (and fixed target) physics to astrophysics (in the form of neutron stars and cosmic rays) to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.
But I'm interested in it all honestly. 
I'm doing numerical calculations these days, never thought I would but it is surprisingly fun.
